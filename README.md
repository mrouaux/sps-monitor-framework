Framework for Dynamic Scaling in Master-Slave Stream Processing Systems
=======================================================================

This is a generic Java framework to support dynamic auto-scaling in Stream Processing Systems architected following a master-slave paradigm. The framework is based on an abstract model for scaling policies, which can be specified using an embedded domain-specific language as shown below:

```java

```

The framework can be built easily using Maven (see http://maven.apache.org/ for more details). Executing the target _install_ will build the framework and run a set of unit and integration tests that validate the functional correctness of the system.
